The input to qhull appears to be less than 3 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p3(v3):   -47 3.7e+02 3.1e+02
- p8(v2):    53 -3.7e+02 -3.1e+02
- p4(v1): 3.7e+02   -47 3.1e+02
- p7(v0): -3.7e+02    53 -3.1e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 5.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    1.553    1.553  -0.3768

facet p8 p4 p7 distance= -7.4e-15
facet p3 p4 p7 distance= -7.2e-15
facet p3 p8 p7 distance= -2.1e-14
facet p3 p8 p4 distance= -5e-14

These points are the dual of the given halfspaces.  They indicate that
the intersection is degenerate.

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:    -373.4       374  difference= 747.4
  1:    -373.4       374  difference= 747.4
  2:    -314.9     314.1  difference=  629

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 5.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

The input to qhull appears to be less than 3 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p7(v3): -1.1e+02 3.6e+02 3.2e+02
- p12(v2): 1.2e+02 -3.6e+02 -3.2e+02

- p11(v0): -3.6e+02 1.2e+02 -3.2e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 5e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    1.566    1.566 -0.09201

facet p12 p8 p11 distance= -1.1e-15
facet p7 p8 p11 distance= -1.5e-15
facet p7 p12 p11 distance= -3e-14
facet p7 p12 p8 distance= -1.5e-15

These points are the dual of the given halfspaces.  They indicate that
the intersection is degenerate.

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:    -360.2     361.7  difference= 721.9
  1:    -360.2     361.7  difference= 721.9
  2:    -324.1     323.9  difference= 647.9

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 5e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

QH6114 qhull precision error: initial simplex is not convex. Distance=0

While executing:  | qhull H0
Options selected for Qhull 2012.1 2012/02/18:
  run-id 2121156859  Halfspace-about  0  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum

  Width-outside 2.4e-12  _wide-facet 7.2e-12  _narrow-hull -2.2e-16

The input to qhull appears to be less than 3 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p2(v3):    31 4.3e+02 2.2e+02
- p7(v2):   -29 -4.3e+02 -2.3e+02
- p3(v1): 4.3e+02    31 2.2e+02
- p6(v0): -4.3e+02   -29 -2.3e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 6e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point   0.4922   0.4922   -1.944

facet p7 p3 p6 distance= -8.2e-15
facet p2 p3 p6 distance= -2e-14
facet p2 p7 p6 distance= -2e-14
facet p2 p7 p3 distance= -2e-14

These points are the dual of the given halfspaces.  They indicate that
the intersection is degenerate.

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:    -430.2     430.2  difference= 860.4
  1:    -430.2     430.2  difference= 860.4
  2:    -225.7     221.8  difference= 447.5

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 6e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

The input to qhull appears to be less than 3 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    30 4.3e+02 2.3e+02
- p6(v2):   -28 -4.3e+02 -2.3e+02
- p2(v1): 4.3e+02    30 2.3e+02
- p5(v0): -4.3e+02   -28 -2.3e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 5.9e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    0.513    0.513   -1.934

facet p6 p2 p5 distance= -3.2e-14
facet p1 p2 p5 distance= -2.5e-14
facet p1 p6 p5 distance= -2.5e-14
facet p1 p6 p2 distance= -2.5e-14

These points are the dual of the given halfspaces.  They indicate that
the intersection is degenerate.

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:    -427.4     427.6  difference= 855.1
  1:    -427.4     427.6  difference= 855.1
  2:    -230.2     226.3  difference= 456.5

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 5.9e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

- p6(v2):   -17 -4e+02 -2.7e+02
- p2(v1): 4e+02    18 2.6e+02
- p5(v0): -4e+02   -17 -2.7e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 5.6e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point   0.6711   0.6711   -1.825

facet p6 p2 p5 distance= -1.7e-14
facet p1 p2 p5 distance= -1.1e-14
facet p1 p6 p5 distance= -4e-14
facet p1 p6 p2 distance= -3.9e-14

These points are the dual of the given halfspaces.  They indicate that
the intersection is degenerate.

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:    -403.4     404.3  difference= 807.6
  1:    -403.4     404.3  difference= 807.6
  2:    -265.1     261.5  difference= 526.6

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 5.6e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.
